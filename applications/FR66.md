# FR66

FR66 is a desktop application with an embedded proxy web site and one socket connection to the FR application.
The embedded web site is similar to the version that is normally contained in the full FR Application.

FR66 contains only the front end web pages, not the computations.
The stateless web pages will be using the (standing) network connection to the stateful FR application, 
so that part of the response to the http request can be provided by the FR application.

The partner component if form of the FR Applikation (z.B. FR04) can be reached in exactly the same way by
other implementations of the web front end. 
The only requirement that is needed is the ability to establish and use a connection to the FR application, in the usual way.

It is up to you to implement a web front end in using any new technology you choose. 
You can continue to use FR as a backend and, within the replacement for FR66, concentrate on the aspect of look (style)
or perhaps access control.

The features that FR66 provides may make it easier to test the system.
