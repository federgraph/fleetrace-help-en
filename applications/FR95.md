# FR95

![FR95 screenshot](../images/FR95.png)

FR95 meets following use cases:
- Viewing of competition data (event part only).
- Manual input of timing data.
- Server for timing data.

Compared to FR92 the following features were removed:
- Bridge
- Switch
- Event

Driving intent for the FR95 feature cut:
- The program shall no longer carry the event part.

In FR95 there is only the race part. 
It is the opposite to [FR94](FR94.html), which only has the event part.

The use of FR95 is focusing on the timing of a race. 
Since the race part is independent of the type of sport,
FR95 could be used to help with the timing in other sport as well.

Times can be recorded manually by the internal timing client.
But it is intended that an external [Timing Client](FR38.html) (Simulator) is used 
or a real timer / sensor.
