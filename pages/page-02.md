# Fleetrace

Continuation

## Participants

The participants in a regatta and/or their supporting team can work together to quickly input the results themselves. 
You do not need a Server at all, 
if the data is distributed by traditional means or a simple static website is used.

## Class association

As a class association you could carry a server box and network devices from one event to the next. 
Importing results into your own result database can be automated further, 
because you no longer have to deal with different data formats used for the official results. 
Errors in the official results can be spotted easier and earlier.

## Clubs

As a sailing club you could operate a server and provide paperless access to the results to the participants in a regatta over the Intranet or Internet. 
You could run the FR system in parallel to the primary result system. 
Or you could simply use the FR system standalone. 
Try it out yourself. 

## Hosting

Server is an overloaded term. 
Hosting means uploading data to a website with or without database. 
The work of data acquisition is always the same, no matter where the data is eventually put.
