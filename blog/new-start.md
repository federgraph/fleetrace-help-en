## Important Update 2019

I have uploaded the source code of FR01 to GitHub. License is GPL 3.0.

## New Start of blog ( 2012-06 )

Original Text removed.

## Example (of how to use FR01, use case)

> The program does not have a main menu; and there is no menu item **Save**.

But you can copy data in Text and Html format out of the Memo control,
and save using a text editor of your choice, at a location of your choosing.

1. You can then upload the Html data to your web site, using the method you prefer. 

2. Inside the application you can then configure the Url to the uploaded file. 

3. Then find a way to notify your *Team* about the Url,
so that they can download *current results* in FR01 and watch those in full color.

Here in the blog you should find some help.

- It works. 
- You only need to decide how you want to set it up, not everything is preconfigured and hard coded.
- But who would be a potential user?
- Simple: all who understand how it works.
