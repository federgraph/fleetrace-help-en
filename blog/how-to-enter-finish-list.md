# How to enter a finish list

In the text on page FR01 I say that you can quickly enter the results of a race.

Here is how, the short version:

- start FR01
- select server in combo
- click Get
- select category
- click on event
- close menu
- open timing
- select current Race
- (clear out existing race data)
- select bib
- press Space
- send message
- activate auto send mode
- select bib and press space
- repeat for all remaining finishers
- close timing
- enter penalties
- sort by column total
- explore current standing
- close FR01

And a slightly longer version:

- start FR01 from folder on hard disc
- in left combo box, select server from which to download EventMenu.xml
- click on button Get to download and process EventMenu.xml, category combo will update
- in right combo box, select category, watch event button bar update
- click on event button, wait for data in Grid on tab Event to update
- click Menu button to close north container
- click Timing button to open south container with tab timing
- use button R+ on toolbar to select the current Race
- (use button Clear to clear out existing race data in the example file)
- use mouse to select cell for bib (bow number) in Grid on tab timing
- still on tab timing press Space bar to generate a message, watch lower edit box update
- use Send button to send the message in the lower edit box
- click button to switch auto send mode on
- select another bib cell in timing grid and press Space
- repeat for all remaining finishers in the race
- click on button Age then close the south container, it is no longer needed
- enter penalties for entries in the race if any
- sort by column total
- explore the current standing, play by changing finish positions
- close FR01
